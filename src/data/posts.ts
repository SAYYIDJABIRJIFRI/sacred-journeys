      "Few names evoke the early history of Islam in India as profoundly as Malik Dinar. A companion of the Prophet Muhammad ﷺ in some traditions, and a tabi'i in others, his arrival on the Malabar Coast marks one of the earliest peaceful encounters between Islam and the Indian subcontinent.",

      "According to the chronicles preserved in the Qissat Shakarwati Farmad, Malik Dinar travelled from Arabia to the kingdom of Cheraman Perumal — a Hindu monarch who is said to have witnessed the splitting of the moon and embarked on a journey to Mecca to embrace Islam. Following the king's instructions, Malik Dinar and his companions established the first mosques along the coast.",
      { h: "The Cheraman Juma Masjid" },
      "Built in 629 CE in present-day Methala, Kodungallur, the Cheraman Juma Masjid is widely regarded as the first mosque in the Indian subcontinent — and one of the oldest in the world. Its modest wooden structure, restored over centuries, still echoes the original Kerala vernacular architecture.",
      { h: "A Legacy Across the Coast" },
      "Malik Dinar is believed to have founded mosques in Kollam, Madayi, Barkur, Mangalore, Kasaragod, Srikandapuram and Dharmadam. His tomb in Thalangara, Kasaragod remains a site of ziyarath for thousands of pilgrims every year — a quiet, fragrant courtyard shaded by old trees, where history feels remarkably close.",

In Islamic practice, it refers to visiting sacred places: the mosques of the Prophet ﷺ and his companions, the resting places of scholars and saints, and historical sites that connect the believer to the wider story of the ummah.",
